# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer_Analysis:

 PyBer is a python based ride-sharing app company. I as a data analyst for PyBer used data visualization to help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine        affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 
In this challenge,First, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, I used Pandas and Mathplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources:

  - Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
  - Software: Python 3.8.3, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.6, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results:

 - The below results can be achived based on the below table and multi-line graph: 
 
    - There are substantially more rides and drivers in urban cities than suburban and rural cities.
    - Urban cities have the highest total fares and rural cities have the lowest one.
    - There is a correlation between number of rides and the average fare per city. Since rural cities has the minimum total rides and drivers, it has the highest average fare per ride and driver.
    - Urban city graph is significantly higher than others. It shows that total fares for urban cities are higher than suburban and rural cities.
    - As the multi-line graph shows, total fares during January are less than other months.
