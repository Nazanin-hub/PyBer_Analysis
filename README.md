# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer_Analysis:

 PyBer is a python based ride-sharing app company. I as a data analyst for PyBer used data visualization to help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine        affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 
In this challenge, First, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, I used Pandas and Mathplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources:

  - Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
  - Software: Python 3.8.3, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.6, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results:

 - The results below can be achived based on the table below and multi-line graph: 
 
    - There are substantially more rides and drivers in urban cities than suburban and rural cities.
    - Urban cities have the highest total fares and rural cities have the lowest one.
    - There is a negative correlation between number of rides and driver with the average fare per ride and driver. Since rural city has the minimum total rides and drivers, it has the highest average fare per ride and driver.
    - Urban city graph is significantly higher than others. It shows that total fares for urban city is much higher than suburban and rural cities.
    - As the multi-line graph shows, total fares during January are less than other months.

## Summary:
 
   - Decreasing the average fare per ride and driver in suburban and rural cities can result in increasing the number of rides and drivers in these cities.
   - Since urban city has the highest total fare, expanding the market in urban cities can result in higher revenue stream.
   - Lenght of the ride can results in more accurate analyze of average fare per ride and driver. Number of drivers and rides can have correlation with duration of the ride. 
   - Analyzing data in 5 or 10 years can lead to more accurate results.
   - Some information about the age and population of the cities can shed more light on the reason why some of the city types have high average fare per driver and ride.
